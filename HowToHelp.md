# How to Volunteer

Contribute your ideas in the project Ideas tab ( write about them first in the discussions tab )<br>
Contribute code ( Once the programming phase has begun )<br>
Find Information for the projects wiki and map<br>

If you have another way you can help, just message me @The North Wind on BCUSA Forums<br>
Or add it to the discussion here<br>

Be wary of adding new files, it wouldnt be good if the project got cramped. Edit existing ones first<br>
